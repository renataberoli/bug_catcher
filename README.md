### About the project
Bug catcher is a pet-project loosely inspired by GitHub Issues and designed with the primary goal of improving my skills in the
Django framework.

#### Sketch

The sketch is the most basic structure I designed within the project. It's an excellent way to put the ideas on paper and start initial tests. Also, working as a developer, I use the sketch to understand the structures of information and draft the models I need to create my system.

#### The solution
After sketching the interfaces and the system architecture, I translate my sketch into a coding interface with Bootstrap.

#### Responsive layout
I focused the development on working primarily in desktop systems but was careful to keep minimum responsiveness in mobile devices.
