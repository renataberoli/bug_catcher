### About the project
This project is a Pet-project that I created to learn more about the Django framework. Bug catcher is an issue tracker 
that aims to simplicity and be useful for small teams that use or not agile methodologies.

#### Sketch
As a designer, is common to me create a sketch from the product/system/service I'm building in the beginning of the project. 
It's a great opportunity to put the ideas on the paper and start a do some initial tests. In this case I try to keep the most 
basic functions of an issue tracker and system with the pattern of the bootstrap framework.

This is not a design project, so I keep the raw idea of the system and went ahead for the code to translate my sketch in 
an interface with Bootstrap patterns. 


#### The solution
This is a final version of my system. It's a desktop app.

#### Layout responsive
I had the attention of keep all the interfaces responsible, even the most common use of this kind of system being desktop.

- [x] Create the basic structure of the system (CRUD - create, read, update and delete).
- [x] Create a place where the issues will be listed to the user.
- [x] Add a pagination for this list of issues. 
- [x] Create a series of list filters to help the user find what he wants.
- [x] Create a login and authentication flow.
- [x] Improve the UI to meet the mockups design before.
- [x] Improve the software's documentation.
- [ ] Write some basic tests to make sure that the system is working as expected.
